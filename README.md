Overview of the project:

Presentation requirements -

Elevator pitch: This is a real estate app that provides localised data in addition to the information of the house or apartment. 

Concept: 
        What is your user story: 
            As a homebuyer. 
            I want to see greater information on the area that I am looking at.
            In order to be more confident in my real estate purchase.
            
        What was your motivation for development?:
            Whenever I look though areas and houses on zillow, I would like more information on the area the property is located, in addition to the property info. However, they only really have information on the property itself. This causes me to have to use a different website for addtional infromation. The application aleviates that by adding the infromation on the same page as the real estae property.

Process: 
    What were the technologies used?: 
        HTML,CSS,JS,Jquery,API's,Uikit 
    How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned?:
        Elliot: HTML/CSS/Uikit
        Samer: HTML/CSS/Uikit
        JP: JS/Jquery/API
        Lyric: JS/Jquery/API

    What challenges did you encounter?: 
        All Crime rate API are terrible 
    What were your successes?: 
        Getting all the other API's too work. Being able to provide extremely localised data based on the properties.

Directions for Future Development:
    Get a functioning crime rate API
    Add a map that displays more infromation like "attractions" and "resturants"
    Make the UI more modern
